### Module 9 sql-challenge
-------------------------

As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, my first task was to conduct a research project on the company's employees during the 1980s and 90s. I was provided with 6 CSV files for this task, which I analyzed by importing them into PgAdmin and running SQL queries.

### STEPS FOR COMPLETIONS

## Data Modeling
* An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to define the relationships necessary for table creation. The employees table was designated as the primary reference key, enabling the linkage of all other tables.

## Data Engineering
* PostgreSQL table schemas were designed, and the corresponding CSV files were imported into the appropriate tables.

## Data Analysis
* SQL queries were developed to address specific business questions:

   - A list of all employees in specific departments was generated.
   - Managers were identified along with their corresponding departments.
   - Frequency counts of last names were calculated to reveal naming patterns within the company.
   - Employees were filtered based on custom criteria such as hire dates and names.
