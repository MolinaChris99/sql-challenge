### Module 9 sql-challenge ###
-------------------------

As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, my first task was to conduct a research project on the company's employees during the 1980s and 90s. I was provided with 6 CSV files for this task, which I analyzed by importing them into PgAdmin and running SQL queries.
